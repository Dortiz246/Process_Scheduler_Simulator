  <em>Comparing the efficiency of algorithms<br>CS-630-003: Team A19</em>
</p>

## Overview
This project aims to simulate a process scheduler utilizing various scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin, and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). The purpose is to visualize the scheduling of processes and compare the efficiency of these algorithms in managing the order and execution of processes within a computing environment.

The project will be written in Python.

## Features
This project will explore three different scheduling algorithms:
1. <b>FCFS (First Come First Serve)</b>: Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.
2. <b>Round Robin</b>: The scheduler has an assigned time slice for each process and evenly allocates and cyles through each process until all are completed.
3. <b>SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)</b>: Processes are executed in the order of their remaining time, shortest remaining time being executed first.
## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.6 or later. No additional libraries are required.
This project was created in Visual Studio Code.
## Usage
To use this project, first clone the repository.
Then, you can run the scheduling algorithms with your own inputs when you run the scheduler.py file.
To run the scheduler.py file you can use ctrl+f5 or press the run button on the top right corner if using VSCode.
