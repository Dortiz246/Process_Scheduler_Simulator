  <em>Comparing the efficiency of algorithms<br>CS-630-003: Team A19</em>
</p>

## Overview
This project aims to simulate a process scheduler utilizing various scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority Scheduling. The purpose is to visualize the scheduling of processes and compare the efficiency of these algorithms in managing the order and execution of processes within a computing environment.

The project will be written in Python.

## Features
This project will explore three different scheduling algorithms:
1. <b>FCFS (First Come First Serve)</b>: Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.
2. <b>SJF (Shortest Job First)</b>: The scheduler executes the shortest job first among the available processes.
3. <b>Priority Scheduling</b>: Processes are executed based on their priority levels.
